**Overview** 

This project focuses on predicting obesity levels based on various eating habits and physical attributes. 
The dataset is preprocessed through extensive data manipulation, followed by exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.
A machine learning model is then trained and optimized using hyperparameter tuning to achieve the best performance. 
The final Random Forest model achieves an impressive accuracy of **91%**.


**Insights**  

- **Data Processing**: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and performed feature selection to enhance model performance.
- **EDA & Feature Engineering**: Explored correlations between features, visualized distributions, applied transformations such as encoding and scaling.
- **Handling Class Imbalance**:Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique was applied to generate synthetic samples for minority class.
- **Model Training & Tuning**: Implemented a Random Forest model and fine-tuned it using GridSearchCV to optimize hyperparameters.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessed the model using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability and effectiveness.


**Outcome** 

- Successfully built a predictive model with **91% accuracy** that can help in early identification and prevent strategies.
- Gained valuable insights into the impact of lifestyle choices on obesity levels.
- Improved model generalization through hyperparameter tuning and performance optimization.

This project serves as a comprehensive case study on applying machine learning techniques to healthcare-related classification problems and 
demonstrating the importance of data-driven insights in healthcare applications.
